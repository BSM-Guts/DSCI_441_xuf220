This is a brief description about the project.
If the project has new commits after that, then the description in readme file will also be updated accodingly.

Heart.csv file comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset?datasetId=1226038
This is the data used in the main.py file.

Tabular_To_Graph.ipynb this file can conver the data Heart.csv from tabular format to graph.
Usually users don't need this file since it's incorprated in the Main_Notebook.ipynb

Main_Notebook.ipynb is the main python file of ipython notebook style, execute blocks in sequnce should be able to make this code work.
Each block has comment to help users understand how to make it work.
Simply execute block one by one will be the right way to use it.

Q: How to know if it's working fine?  
A: At the end of the project you should see pictures of the classifcied nodes and the value of cross entropy loss.

To run the demo, please use Demo_complete.ipynb. All the results and outputs of each block are shown in the notebook.
Simply execute each block one after one will be working fine. Demo_1 is an unfinished demeo file. 

The Abstract of the project is here:

Extracting medical data is progressively becoming
more and more significant for the prediction and treatment of
high death rates due to heart attacks. A tremendous amount of
data related to heart attacks is produced every day, which allows
people to train data-driven machine learning(ML) models for
heart attack prediction. Compared to traditional ML algorithms,
artificial neural network and its variants are of great interest
since they are more capable of learning complex patterns and
relationships within the data. In this paper, we propose an
approach for heart attack prediction based on a Graph Convolutional Neural Network(GCN), which can predict the occurrence
of a heart attack based on medical data in graph format. The
objective of this paper is to test the feasibility of employing GCN
in heart attack prediction problems and evaluate the performance
of this GCN-based application.
